### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Michael and I'm a second year software engineering student at Ontario Tech University. I have experience with web development and software development. I will be collaborating on a project with other students in my program in the coming weeks. I hope to add to more projects to this account as I am just getting started on GitHub. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
